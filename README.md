# Google Location History Visualisation

This project involves visualising my location history data downloaded from Google Maps. The project is based on Geoff Boeing's blog post here (https://geoffboeing.com/2016/06/mapping-everywhere-ever-been/) and GitHub Repo here (https://geoffboeing.com/2016/06/mapping-everywhere-ever-been/).

I used this project to give myself an introduction into Python and data analytics.
